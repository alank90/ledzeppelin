          Edward&apos;s reign was marked by economic problems and social unrest

          In February 1553, at age 15, Edward fell ill. When his sickness was
          discovered to be terminal, he and his Council drew up a &quot;Devise

          In fact, Henry VIII&apos;s will did not provide for the appointment of

          Wriothesley, a religious conservative, objected to Somerset&apos;s
          assumption of monarchical power over the Council. He then found
          himself abruptly dismissed from the chancellorship on charges of
          selling off some of his offices to delegates.
        </p>
        <h2>Thomas Seymour</h2>
        Somerset faced less manageable opposition from his younger brother
        Thomas Seymour, who has been described as a "worm in the bud".[67] As
        King Edward's uncle, Thomas Seymour demanded the governorship of the
        king's person and a greater share of power.[68] Somerset tried to buy
        his brother off with a barony, an appointment to the Lord Admiralship,
        and a seat on the Privy Council—but Thomas was bent on scheming for
        power. He began smuggling pocket money to King Edward, telling him that
        Somerset held the purse strings too tight, making him a "beggarly
        king".[69] He also urged him to throw off the Protector within two years
        and "bear rule as other kings do"; but Edward, schooled to defer to the
        Council, failed to co-operate.[70] In the spring of 1547, using Edward's
        support to circumvent Somerset's opposition, Thomas Seymour secretly
        married Henry VIII's widow Catherine Parr, whose Protestant household
        included the 11-year-old Lady Jane Grey and the 13-year-old Lady
        Elizabeth.[71] In summer 1548, a pregnant Catherine Parr discovered
        Thomas Seymour embracing Lady Elizabeth.[72] As a result, Elizabeth was
        removed from Catherine Parr's household and transferred to Sir Anthony
        Denny's. That September, Catherine Parr died shortly after childbirth,
        and Thomas Seymour promptly resumed his attentions to Elizabeth by
        letter, planning to marry her. Elizabeth was receptive, but, like
        Edward, unready to agree to anything unless permitted by the
        Council.[73] In January 1549, the Council had Thomas Seymour arrested on
        various charges, including embezzlement at the Bristol mint. King
        Edward, whom Seymour was accused of planning to marry to Lady Jane Grey,
        himself testified about the pocket money. Lack of clear evidence for
        treason ruled out a trial, so Seymour was condemned instead by an Act of
        Attainder and beheaded on 20 March 1549.
        <h2>War</h2>

          His initial successes, however, were followed by a loss of direction,

        <h2>Rebellion</h2>
        <p>
          During 1548, England was subject to social unrest. After April 1549, a
          series of armed revolts broke out, fuelled by various religious and
          agrarian grievances. The two most serious rebellions, which required
          major military intervention to put down, were in Devon and Cornwall
          and in Norfolk. The first, sometimes called the
          <a

            title="Prayer Book Rebellion"

            ></sup
          >
          A complex aspect of the social unrest was that the protesters believed
          they were acting legitimately against
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure" title="Enclosure"
            >enclosing</a

          landlords with the Protector&apos;s support, convinced that the

          The same justification for outbreaks of unrest was voiced throughout
          the country, not only in Norfolk and the west. The origin of the
          popular view of Somerset as sympathetic to the rebel cause lies partly
          in his series of sometimes liberal, often contradictory,
          proclamations,<sup

          Whatever the popular view of Somerset, the disastrous events of 1549
          were taken as evidence of a colossal failure of government, and the
          Council laid the responsibility at the Protector&apos;s door.<sup

          By 1 October 1549, Somerset had been alerted that his rule faced a
          serious threat. He issued a proclamation calling for assistance, took
          possession of the king&apos;s person, and withdrew for safety to the

          Meanwhile, a united Council published details of Somerset&apos;s
          government mismanagement. They made clear that the Protector&apos;s
          power came from them, not from Henry VIII&apos;s will. On 11 October,
          the Council had Somerset arrested and brought the king to

          Edward summarised the charges against Somerset in his
          <em>Chronicle</em>: &quot;ambition, vainglory, entering into rash wars
          in mine youth, negligent looking on Newhaven, enriching himself of my

          By autumn 1549, his costly wars had lost momentum, the crown faced
          financial ruin, and riots and rebellions had broken out around the
          country. Until recent decades, Somerset&apos;s reputation with

          Warwick, on the other hand, pinned his hopes on the king&apos;s strong

          to legitimise his authority. Lacking Somerset&apos;s
          blood-relationship with the king, he added members to the Council from
          his own faction in order to control it. He also added members of his

          In the matter of religion, the regime of Northumberland followed the

          Although Edward VI&apos;s practical influence on government was
          limited, his intense Protestantism made a reforming administration
          obligatory; his succession was managed by the reforming faction, who
          continued in power throughout his reign. The man Edward trusted most,
          Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, introduced a series of
          religious reforms that revolutionised the English church from one
          that&mdash;while rejecting papal supremacy&mdash;remained essentially
          Catholic, to one that was institutionally Protestant. The confiscation
          of church property that had begun under Henry VIII resumed under
          Edward&mdash;notably with the dissolution of the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chantries" title="Chantries"
